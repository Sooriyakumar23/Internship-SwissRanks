# 2. Power and Flow monitoring system
  1. Power Monitoring system
    ** Current sensor selection
    ** Feasibility study : power consumption, functionality
    ** Sensor node conceptual design
    ** Display node conceptual design
    ** BOM creation
  2. Flow monitoring system
    ** Proposed two solutions [thermal, ultrasonic sensor]
    ** Theoretical study regarding ultrasonic sensor based flow monitoring
    ** Several experiments conducted using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, arduino and pipeline
    ** Proposed a electronic architecture due to timing limitations
    ** Selected components and partially completed architecture

# 3. Wafer visualization using Mountains8 software

* Warpages of wafers causes tremendous loss to the chip manufacturing companies.
* By visualizing wafers in software can help us to take decision whether the wafer is good enough to proceed or not, also analyze the reason for warpages and amount of warpage quantitatively
* Mountains8 is a highly advanced range of tool for processing measured data and images
* I used Mountains8 software to visualize, process and analyze the data of wafers from sensors in csv/excel file [30 days trial version]
